Grab whatever you want I don't care. Just be careful with my i3 config, don't copy the whole thing, somethings may not work on your system or things might break idk ¯\\_\_(ツ)_\_/¯. Pick up the parts you like from it :)

Do not **BLINDLY** do anything, ever.

Also the configs are messy, BUT EVERYTHING WORKS FINE hehe. I'll cleanup up the messy config sometime later. So go through the config and check the paths, install the necessary fonts and stuff or change if things dont work or look weird.

Fonts used are JetBrainsMono Nerd Font, Font-Awesome and Material Design Icons. You can install them using yay or pacman, whichever works.
