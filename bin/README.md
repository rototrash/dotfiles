## I got most of the stuff in here from [xero's repo](https://github.com/xero/dotfiles/tree/master/fun/bin)
Yeah pretty much everything

## Yoinked the sofetch and palle scripts from [sora6kq's repo](https://github.com/sora6kq/scripts)
Modified the sofetch script just a tiny bit since it wasn't getting my Distro and some minor changes.

## Other stuff (like the ascii stuff)
I just find them somewhere on the Internet (Reddit, Discord, etc)
